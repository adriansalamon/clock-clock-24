## My own ClockClock 24 replica

My own take/version of the ClockClock 24 by [Humans Since 1982](https://www.humanssince1982.com) - A digital clock made from 24 analog clocks.
All credit goes to them for coming up with such an awesome design.

My version is made 100% from scratch using my own hardware design.
Mine is also slightly smaller, made to fit perfectly on my shelf.
This design uses 6 Arduino nanos, each in control of 4 individual
clocks, and an ESP32 which orchestrates and sends commands to all
Arduinos.

The physical clock is made from MDF, which was routed using a 3d
printed jig (I don't own a CNC). That process will not be published.

The software is still WIP and not finished.
